To visualize the number of operations involved in applying Cramer's Rule based on the order of the matrix, we need to understand that Cramer's Rule becomes computationally expensive as the matrix order increases.

The number of operations required for solving a system of linear equations using Cramer's Rule can be roughly estimated as O(n! + nÂ²), where n is the order of the matrix, because each determinant involves recursive expansion (Laplace expansion) over submatrices.

Steps to create the plot:
Cramer's Rule Operations:

The determinant of an n x n matrix is computed through Laplace expansion, which involves recursive computation of determinants of (n-1) x (n-1) matrices.
This recursive nature makes the number of operations grow factorially with matrix order.
Plot: We will create a graph showing the number of operations as a function of the matrix order n.

Let me now generate the plot for you using this understanding.


Here is the graphical representation of the number of operations required by Cramer's Rule versus the matrix order. As shown in the plot, the computational cost grows significantly with the matrix order, primarily due to the factorial growth involved in determinant calculations.
